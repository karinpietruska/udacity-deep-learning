    "**Answer:** I decided to implement a model with 2 LSTM layers (n_layers=2) that are stacked. This would allow for higher, more abstract representations of the sequential data compared to just a single LSTM layer. Referring back the lecture on word embeddings on the Skip_Grams Exercise, it was described that the embedding dimension size (embedding_dim) is usually in the \"100s\". Given the vocabulary size of 21388 I thought an embedding_dim of 200 as a starting point should be sufficient. In the Sentiment Classification exercise, it was described when more hidden_dim units are used in the hidden layers, performance tends to be better. Hidden_dims of 128, 256, and 512 were listed as common starting values for the hidden_dim. So I decided to go for hidden_dim =256 in my first attempt. I initially trained my network with a sequence_length of 50. However, I received a better performance in terms of loss and convergence when I increased the sequenque length further to 100 and finally to 125. I trained the network for 300 epochs. "
